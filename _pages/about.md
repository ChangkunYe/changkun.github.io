I am a final year PhD student at the Australian National University. My research interest includes computer vision, probabilistic machine learning (statistical/Bayesian inference), uncertainty quantification and causal inference. My previous works includes research in reinforcement learning, zero-shot learning, long-tailed learning, label shift problem and model calibration.
