Deploying Deep Neural Network (NN) models into the real world tasks usually face the problem of distribution shift. Specifically, when the data we used to train the model (train set) and test the model (test set) have different data distributions, the model train on the source domain (train) distribution may perform sub-optimally on the target domain (test) distribution.
